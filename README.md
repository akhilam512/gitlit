# GitLit :fire:

Open Source contributions have largely been limited to some popular organizations since it has been difficult for new innovative projects to gain attention and acquire a group of interested and skilled contributors. 
Furthermore, the same is the case for contributors to discover interesting and contributable communities and then to find workable issues and cool features - all in all - a complicated and a time-taking task, often leading many beginners to drop out of Open Source as they lack the know-how to get started.  

GitLit is a web app that rates repositories and contributors through an algorithm which takes into consideration not only a few standard metrics like Stars, Forks, and PRs, but also accounting for factors like Activity in the Community (eg: Issue Resolution, PR Resolution, Feature Addition),  backgrounds of the contributors and many more.

## Target Customers  :bowtie:
GitLit has two primary use-cases, one for the developers to discover interesting projects and the other is for 
people in the industry to find talented and enthusiastic developers. 

**Project Discovery**

* **Students & Beginners:** GitLit can be used by students and beginners to get started into the world of Open Source.
It helps them to break-the-ice, and kick-start their FOSS journey without essentially going into deeper level they can.

* **Developers** GitLit can also be used by amateur as well as professional developers to discover innovate, interesting
and relevant projects to contribute to, based on their skill level.

**Developer Discovery**

* **Developer Advocates:** GitLit can be used by developer advocates to identify enthusiastic and talented 
contributors, who are interested in their organization, and connect with them. It can be also used by them to analyse 
their projects, and monitor community members. 

* **College Clubs:** College based computer clubs like amFOSS, can use GitLit to identify enthusiastic and talented 
 students out of a large pool, effectively monitor them and check their progress.
 
 * **Corporate Recruiters:** Corporate companies can discover developers, with the required talent and passion using
 credible metrics of GitLit
