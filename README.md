# GitLit

The contributions to Open Source have largely been limited to some popular organizations since it has been hard for new innovative projects to gain attention, and acquire a group of interested and talented contributors. 

Furthermore, even for the contributors, discovering interesting and contributable communities, and then to find workable issues and cool features to take up, is, in fact, a complicated and time-taking task, often leading many beginners to drop out of Open Source as they don't know where and how to get started. 

GitLit is a web app that rates repositories and contributors through a logical algorithm which takes into consideration not only a few standard metrics like Stars, Forks, and PRs, but also accounting for factors like Activity in the Community (eg: Issue Resolution, Feature Addition),  backgrounds of the contributors etc.

## Target Customers
